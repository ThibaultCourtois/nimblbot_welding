What This Project Enables
--------------------------

The **NimblBot Welding API** enables the use of every feature of the WeezTouch 
welding specialized controller with NimblBot robots NB55 and NB120. 

Thanks to this API, the WeezTouch user can teleoperate the NimblBot robot in 
cartesian and modular control modes to define different welding trajectories 
such as: linear segments, circle-arcs, splines and horse saddle with the 
Telesoud system that generates commands following these interpolations.

To enhance user experience, a custom RViz plugin comes with this API to help 
control the robot, understand its movements and states, etc.

**Rviz plugin documentation**: :doc:`interface_rviz_plugin`

All the key features of the WeezTouch are explained in its technical manual:
