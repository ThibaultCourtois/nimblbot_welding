Telesoud NimblBot Interface Packages
====================================

The **telesoud_nimblbot_interface** package is the central component of the 
welding system, bridging Telesoud commands with NimblBot robot control through 
its two main modules: the Translator for protocol conversion and the Welding 
Command Handler for robot motion management.
